        <p>Hi, I am Maciej Kuran-Janowski ðŸ‘‹.</p>
        <p>I designed and made this application.</p>
        <p>
          The Saythanku app is a project done for portfolio purposes. In addition to educational
          purposes, I wanted to create an app that is friendly to everyone.

          Saythanku is the application the world needs today. Whether you choose to use it is now
          totally up to you.
